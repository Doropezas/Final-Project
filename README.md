# Emerging Markets Investor Helper

## Overview:
The Emerging Markets Investor Helper is a Python-based application that empowers investors to analyze risks and identify opportunities in emerging markets. It integrates macroeconomic data, currency analysis, and sentiment analysis to produce actionable insights, enabling users to make informed investment decisions.

---

## Features:
### 1. Country Risk Analysis:
- Pull macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, debt-to-GDP ratio, unemployment rate, and current account balance from sources like the World Bank API, IMF API, or other open datasets.
- Score each country using a risk assessment model that factors in economic, political, and social stability.
- Provide visual comparisons across countries, including heatmaps and trend charts.

### 2. Currency Risk Assessment:
- Analyze FX volatility and trends using historical currency exchange rates from APIs such as OANDA or Alpha Vantage.
- Provide metrics like rolling standard deviation, average drawdown, and Value at Risk (VaR).
- Forecast potential movements using basic time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

### 3. Sector Opportunity Scoring:
- Integrate sector performance data (e.g., equity indices, commodity prices) and correlate them with macroeconomic conditions.
- Highlight sectors with strong growth potential or undervaluation.

### 4. News Sentiment Analysis:
- Use financial news APIs (e.g., Reuters, Google News) or web scraping tools (e.g., Beautiful Soup) to gather headlines and articles for emerging markets.
- Apply NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment scoring with Hugging Face, TextBlob, or Vader) to gauge market sentiment.
- Summarize sentiment trends at the country or sector level.

### 5. Investment Report Generator:
- Compile all findings into an automated investment report, including country risk scores, FX trends, sector opportunities, and news sentiment.
- Export the report as a PDF or interactive dashboard.

### 6. Interactive Visualization:
- Develop a dashboard using Streamlit, Dash, or Plotly to allow users to explore data interactively.
- Include features like country comparisons, sentiment trendlines, and sector-specific breakdowns.

## Execution Plan:
### Week 3: Proposal Development
- Research available data sources for macroeconomic, currency, and sector data.
- Identify APIs or datasets for sentiment analysis.

### Week 4: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Set up API connections for macroeconomic, FX, and news data.
- Build a data pipeline to fetch and preprocess data for analysis.

### Week 6: Risk Analysis and Opportunity Scoring
- Implement the country risk scoring model, incorporating macroeconomic and political stability factors.
- Build currency risk analysis tools, including volatility and trend metrics.
- Develop sector scoring logic based on sector performance and economic conditions.

### Week 7: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
- Implement sentiment analysis tools for financial news.
- Create a visualization dashboard to display country comparisons, trends, and sentiment analysis results.

### Week 8: Report Generation and Deployment
- Add functionality to generate PDF reports summarizing all insights.
- Deploy the application using a web framework like Streamlit or Dash.
