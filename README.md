# Emerging Markets Investor Helper

## Overview:
The Emerging Markets Investor Helper is a Python-based application that empowers investors to analyze risks and identify opportunities in emerging markets. It integrates macroeconomic data, currency analysis, and sentiment analysis to produce actionable insights, enabling users to make informed investment decisions.

---

## Features:
### 1. Country Risk Analysis:
- Pull macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, debt-to-GDP ratio, unemployment rate, and current account balance from sources like the World Bank API.
- Score each country using a risk assessment model that factors in economic, political, and social stability.
- Provide visual comparisons across countries, including heatmaps and trend charts.

### 2. Currency Risk Assessment:
- Analyze FX volatility and trends using historical currency exchange rates from APIs such as OANDA or Alpha Vantage.
- Provide metrics like rolling standard deviation, average drawdown, and Value at Risk (VaR).
- Forecast potential movements using basic time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

### 3. News Sentiment Analysis:
- Use financial news APIs (e.g., Reuters, Google News) or web scraping tools (e.g., Beautiful Soup) to gather headlines and articles for emerging markets.
- Apply NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment scoring with Hugging Face) to gauge market sentiment.
- Summarize sentiment trends at the country or sector level.

### 4. Risk Index
- 

### 4. Interactive Visualization:
- Develop a dashboard using Streamlit, Dash, or Plotly to allow users to explore data interactively.
- Include features like country comparisons, sentiment trendlines, and sector-specific breakdowns.
